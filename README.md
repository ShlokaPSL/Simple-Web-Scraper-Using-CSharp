# Simple-Web-Scraper-Using-CSharp

This application scrapes CraigsList to acquire and display the required listings and their associated descriptions.

It first accepts a city name and a category from the user.

The app then builds an internet link from this input and uses it to acquire and display the listings obtained for the city and category mentioned, along with the links and descriptions for theses listings.
